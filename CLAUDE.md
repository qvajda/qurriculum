# qurriculum

This project runs on [qops](https://github.com/qvajda/qops), a ways-of-working
substrate: one CLI, rendered CI workflows, a label taxonomy and a session
brief, all configured by `.qops/config.yml`.

This file is hot path: it enters every session unasked, and it is capped at
**150 lines** by `.qops/config.yml`'s `claude_md_max_lines` and by
`groom.yml`.

## Ways of working

Issues are the source of truth: `gh issue list` on **qvajda/qurriculum** — `qops brief`
names the tracker it read, every time. The issue wins over any planning
document.

Session state, the guard and the metrics are qops itself:
`python -m qops brief|ledger|resume|guard|close|install|doctor|metrics`,
configured entirely by `.qops/config.yml`.

## Conventions

- Commit type + issue number in the branch name: `<type>/<issue#>-<slug>`,
  where type is `feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|test`.
- Reference code as `file:line`.

<!--
`qops init` wrote this file as a starting point. Fill in the project's own
hard constraints, standing decisions and conventions above — this is where
they belong, not in a planning document nobody re-reads.
