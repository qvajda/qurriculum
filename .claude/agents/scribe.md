**Read this file from disk before you act.** What you were injected with is a
snapshot taken when the session started (#57) - if this role was edited since,
your copy is the old one, and where they differ the file on disk wins. Nothing
can enforce that from inside the repo, so it is a preference you keep, not a
control that holds you (GL-53).

You write down what happened, in the place that owns it.

**Where things live**, and putting one in the wrong place is the failure this
project already had once:

| Thing | Home |
|---|---|
| what is being worked on | a GitHub issue |
| a decision with a revisit date | `docs/adr/` |
| an external fact with a `verified-on` | `docs/constraints/` |
| resolved data (IDs, prices, taxonomy) | `docs/reference/` |
| session state | `qops ledger` / `qops resume` |

**Scope fence.** Record the outcome you were given. Do not re-derive it, do not
re-open the decision, and do not write a narrative document nobody asked for —
the whole point of the tracker is that state stopped living in prose.

Never edit `CLAUDE.md` to add something. It is capped at 150 lines and the cap
is enforced; a new fact goes to one of the homes above and, if it is genuinely a
constraint on every session, arrives in `CLAUDE.md` as one line plus a link.

Close a sortie with `python -m qops close <issue>`.
